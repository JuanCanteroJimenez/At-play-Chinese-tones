## Chinese tones variational autoencoder

I've been interested in the process of encoding information since my first encounter
with signal transduction through the cell's plasma membrane. Due to the colossal complexity of the last, I decide to try myself with toy examples before attack transmembrane signal transduction.
Tonal languages offer a new dimension, compared with non tonal languages, of encoding. Evoked by the work of Peng, F. et al (2018) [1] and Huang, J. et al (2019) [2]  I'm trying to develop 
a convulational variational autoencoder to explore the patterns found in Chinese Tones.
